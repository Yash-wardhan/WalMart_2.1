# Walmart Dynamic Image Search and Pop Basket

This project is a Walmart clone with added functionality for dynamic image search and a pop-up basket feature. It is built using Next.js, a React framework for server-rendered React applications.

## Features

- **Dynamic Image Search**: Users can search for products using images instead of text. The system utilizes image recognition technology to match uploaded images with products in the database.
- **Pop-up Basket**: Users can add items to their shopping basket, and a pop-up basket will display the items added in real-time. Users can manage their shopping cart without leaving the main page.
- **Next.js**: The project leverages Next.js for server-side rendering, making the application faster and more SEO-friendly.
